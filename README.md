*Update 2018-12-22: I have abandoned this project in favor of other, more
up-to-date textbooks on algorithms, data structures and program design.
Apologies for the inconvenience.*

Solutions to exercises from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs",
second edition, by Abelson, Sussman and Sussman.

## Information 
Solutions are written in scheme and can be found in each exercise's markdown
(`.md`) file or in its own source file. Some exercises require no code. 

The book and more information is available at <https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/>.

All tests were run on a x86_64 Linux system running with the MIT/GNU Scheme
interpreter and compiler, available online at
<https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/>.
