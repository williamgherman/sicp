### Exercise 1.7.
The `good-enough?` test used in computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers. An alternative strategy for implementing `good-enough?` is to watch how `guess` changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of the guess. Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does this work better for small and large numbers?

*The original* `good-enough?` *returns true if the guess is within a 0.001 precision. By asking for the square root of 0.00001, this precision will return much too large values because of our origial guess of 1.0. Large numbers that are unable to fit in an 32-bit or 64-bit integer will completely fail, depending on machine, and large floating-point numbers returned by* `good-enough?` *will keep guessing forever because of the precision errors generated by most machines.*

*One way to overcome this is to have the process accept an answer as good enough if the guess is off by a certain percentage rather than a certain absolute value.:*

```scheme
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (improve guess x) guess))
     (* guess 0.001)))
```
